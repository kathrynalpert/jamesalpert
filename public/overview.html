			  <h3>Care Philosophy:</h3>
			  <p>Education, training and experience in the practice of various psychotherapies are important
        aspects of psychiatric treatment that have been omitted from the repertoire of some
        psychiatrists.  Expertise in the use of medications is necessary but not sufficient for complete
        psychiatric work.  It is important to find a psychiatrist with a sound understanding of the
        history, fundamentals and practice of psychotherapy along with the experience to integrate
        them with medication, if necessary.  Frequently, people I work with have had previous
        therapies that were not helpful enough. They became discouraged and started to believe that
        their problems were not amenable to treatment or change.  It is worthwhile putting forth the
        extra effort it may take to find a psychiatrist who can help you avoid or begin to move out of
        that state. It may take a few sessions to allow yourself the time to feel confident you are
        talking with someone who is knowledgeable, versatile, and able to understand your views.
        There are usually psychiatrists in a community that have this knowledge and experience.</p>
        <p>Psychiatry is a field where it is dangerous to practice with a model that is too simple.  A
        reductionistic model may work well to explain a point.  If only one model, mode or
        conceptualization is understood, however, it will limit the types of treatment and the flexibility
        a psychiatrist needs to help someone.  People are extraordinarily complex, fortunately.  
        George Engel, M.D. at the University of Rochester School of Medicine coined the term
        <strong>biopsychosocial</strong> to begin to describe this complexity.</p>
        <p>Humans are biological, psychological and social beings.  Each of these aspects should
        eventually be considered and discussed in an ideal treatment.  Psychiatrists have to
        understand and integrate all aspects of this model regularly in order to help people most
        effectively.  Relationships, vocations, avocations, goals and aspirations are all important
        considerations.  Matters of temperament, biological endowments and biological treatments
        must not be ignored, nor should they dominate.  The field of mental health is complex and
        easily misunderstood.  Thus, it is necessary to be able to communicate clearly, freely in the
        context of a relationship where terms of common sense and mutually understood logic have
        been allowed to develop.  Since the issues are usually emotionally laden and multifaceted this
        takes time, which varies quite a bit depending on the particulars.  A personal relationship
        must develop in order to discuss the feelings and thoughts involved. This is a rewarding area
        of medicine in which to practice.</p>
